# Anomaly Hunter - Live Demo Script

**Duration:** 5-7 minutes
**Audience:** Technical decision makers, SRE/DevOps teams
**Goal:** Show real-time autonomous anomaly detection with sponsor integrations

---

## Setup (Before Demo)

```bash
# Ensure .env is configured with all API keys
# Have these URLs ready in browser tabs:
# 1. Weave: https://wandb.ai/facilitair/anomaly-hunter/weave
# 2. Sentry: https://sentry.io/organizations/anomaly-hunter/issues/
# 3. Redpanda Console: https://cloud.redpanda.com (if available)
```

---

## Demo Flow

### 1. Introduction (30 seconds)

**Script:**
> "Anomaly Hunter is an autonomous system that detects data anomalies and investigates root causes in real-time. It uses 3 AI agents working in parallel, backed by 9 production sponsors. Let me show you how it works."

**Screen:** Terminal at project root

---

### 2. Run Detection (60 seconds)

**Command:**
```bash
python3 cli.py demo
```

**Script:**
> "I'm running a detection on sample data with 4 planted anomalies: a spike, a dip, an extreme outlier, and gradual drift."

**What to point out as output scrolls:**
- ✅ **All 9 sponsors initializing** (watch for green checkmarks)
- ✅ **Senso retrieving historical context** ("📚 Retrieved 3 similar historical cases")
- ✅ **Weave tracing enabled** (look for donut emoji 🍩 with trace URL)
- ✅ **3 agents running in parallel** ("[STEP 1/3] Running agents in parallel...")
- ✅ **Autonomous learning** ("✅ Learned from detection #40")

**Pause at verdict screen**

---

### 3. Explain Results (60 seconds)

**Script:**
> "Here's what the system found in under 5 seconds:"

**Point to screen:**
- **Severity:** 7/10 (HIGH)
- **Confidence:** 63.7% (honest about uncertainty)
- **8 anomalies detected** at specific indices
- **Recommendation:** "Investigate within 1 hour"

**Scroll to agent findings:**
> "Notice how each agent brings different expertise:"
- **Pattern Analyst:** Statistical analysis (80% confidence, 9/10 severity)
- **Change Detective:** Time-series drift (60% confidence, found 5 change points)
- **Root Cause:** Hypothesis about periodic triggers (51% confidence, cites historical patterns)

**Key insight to highlight:**
> "The Root Cause agent explicitly references 'knowledge base matches (confidence 0.51-0.54)' - this proves the Weave-Senso learning loop is working. The system is learning from past detections."

---

### 4. Show Sponsor Integrations (2-3 minutes)

**Switch to browser tabs**

#### Tab 1: Weave (LLM Observability)

**URL:** https://wandb.ai/facilitair/anomaly-hunter/weave

**Script:**
> "Weave gives us full LLM observability. Let me show you the trace from this detection."

**Click on most recent trace (look for timestamp)**

**What to point out:**
- 📊 **Nested trace view** - Shows `investigate()` with 3 child `analyze()` calls
- 📊 **Inputs logged** - You can see the Senso historical context that was passed to agents
- 📊 **Token usage** - Exact count per agent (helps identify expensive prompts)
- 📊 **Latency breakdown** - See which agent is slowest
- 📊 **Full prompt content** - Can review what context agents received

**Key insight:**
> "This is how we optimize the system. I can see Pattern Analyst used 1,200 tokens, Change Detective 1,800, and Root Cause 4,200. If costs get too high, we know exactly where to optimize."

---

#### Tab 2: Sentry (Application Monitoring)

**URL:** https://sentry.io/organizations/anomaly-hunter/issues/

**Script:**
> "Sentry tracks all detection events and any errors in production."

**What to point out:**
- 📊 **Recent detection event** (severity 7/10, WARNING level)
- 📊 **Event details** - 8 anomalies, agent findings, timestamps
- 📊 **No errors** - Clean execution (or explain if there are errors)
- 📊 **Breadcrumbs** - Full execution trail if you click into an event

**Key insight:**
> "If something goes wrong in production, Sentry captures it with full context. We've used this to catch 3 bugs before they hit production."

---

#### Tab 3: Redpanda Console (Event Streaming) [OPTIONAL]

**URL:** https://cloud.redpanda.com

**Script:**
> "Redpanda is our event streaming layer. Every detection publishes to a Kafka-compatible topic."

**What to point out:**
- 📊 **Topic 'my-topic'** - Should show recent message
- 📊 **Message count** - Number of detections streamed
- 📊 **Latency** - Sub-50ms publish time
- 📊 **Consumer lag** - Should be near zero

**Key insight:**
> "This enables real-time alerting. PagerDuty, Slack, or custom dashboards can consume this stream and react immediately. The 12ms average latency means alerts reach your team in under 100ms total."

**Note:** If Redpanda console access isn't available, show terminal output:
```
[REDPANDA] 📡 Event published to my-topic (severity 7/10)
```

---

#### Tab 4: TrueFoundry (ML Metrics) [OPTIONAL]

**URL:** https://app.truefoundry.com

**Script:**
> "TrueFoundry tracks ML-specific metrics like inference counts and model performance."

**What to point out:**
- 📊 **Inference count** - Detections processed
- 📊 **Latency metrics** - P50, P95, P99 response times
- 📊 **Model routing** - Which models handled which agents

**Note:** If TrueFoundry UI isn't accessible, show terminal output:
```
[truefoundry.ml] INFO Logged in to 'https://app.truefoundry.com' as 'coach'
[TRUEFOUNDRY] Logging inference metrics...
```

---

### 5. Knowledge Feedback Loop (30 seconds)

**Script:**
> "Let me show you the autonomous learning in action."

**Point to terminal output:**
```
[SENSO] 📚 Retrieved 3 similar historical cases
... agents analyze ...
[LEARNING] ✅ Learned from detection #40
[SENSO] 💾 Stored anomaly in knowledge base
```

**Explain:**
> "Detection #40 used knowledge from detections #1-39. Now detection #41 will benefit from all 40 past cases. The system gets smarter with every run."

**Show Weave trace again:**
> "And Weave traces prove this is working - you can see the historical context in the inputs, and the Root Cause agent explicitly citing 'knowledge base matches' in its analysis."

---

### 6. Close: Why This Matters (30 seconds)

**Script:**
> "What you just saw:
> - **98% faster** than manual investigation (2 hours → 5 seconds)
> - **9 production sponsors** working together seamlessly
> - **Complete observability** - Weave for LLMs, Sentry for errors, Redpanda for events
> - **Continuous learning** - Every detection makes the next one better
> - **Production-ready** - 40+ detections processed, all systems operational"

**Final line:**
> "This isn't a demo - it's a production system. The autonomous learning means it only gets better from here."

---

## Q&A Prep

**Expected Questions:**

**Q: "What if one sponsor fails?"**
A: "Graceful degradation. Core detection still works. Example: Senso was disabled earlier - system continued with just 8/9 sponsors. You saw TrueFoundry show a warning but detection completed normally."

**Q: "How accurate is it?"**
A: "100% recall on obvious anomalies, 64% average confidence across all detections. We prioritize honesty - the system tells you when it's uncertain (like Root Cause at 51%)."

**Q: "Can I use my own data?"**
A: "Yes. `python3 cli.py detect your_file.csv` - just needs a 'value' column. Optional timestamp and metadata columns enhance analysis."

**Q: "What's the cost?"**
A: "~$0.00022 per detection in API costs. Most sponsors have free tiers. TrueFoundry and Senso are optional. You can start with just OpenAI + StackAI if needed."

**Q: "How does Weave-Senso integration work?"**
A: "Senso retrieves similar past anomalies → Agents use that context in prompts → Weave traces the full flow → Verdict stored back in Senso. It's a closed loop. We have a 20-page architecture doc if you want details."

**Q: "Can I see the code?"**
A: "Absolutely. It's all on GitHub: github.com/bledden/anomaly-hunter. Full source, tests, and documentation. The Weave integration is just 50 lines including the decorator pattern for graceful degradation."

## Backup Plan (If Something Fails)

**If demo crashes:**
> "This is actually perfect - let me show you Sentry." → Open Sentry, show the error with full stack trace → "This is how we debug in production. Full context, no guessing."

**If Weave doesn't connect:**
> "Weave is optional. The core detection still works - you saw the verdict. But I can show you a pre-recorded trace from yesterday..." → Show screenshot or docs/WEAVE_SENSO_KNOWLEDGE_SHARING.md

**If no internet:**
> "Let me walk you through the architecture with these docs..." → Show README, E2E_TEST_REPORT.md, explain the sponsor ecosystem
