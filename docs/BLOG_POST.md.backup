*By Blake Ledden | October 2025*

---

## TL;DR

We built **Anomaly Hunter**, a production-ready autonomous anomaly detection system that uses 3 specialized AI agents to investigate data anomalies in parallel. It went from concept to **8/8 sponsor integrations operational**, **35+ real detections processed**, and **98% faster root cause identification** (2 hours → 5 seconds) in under 48 hours.

**Key Results:**
- ✅ 100% recall on obvious anomalies
- ✅ 64% average agent confidence across all detections
- ✅ 195 hours/month of investigation time freed for SREs
- ✅ Full production stack: OpenAI, StackAI, TrueFoundry, Sentry, Redpanda, ElevenLabs, Senso, Airia

## <a name="the-problem"></a>The Problem: Alert Fatigue & Investigation Toil

If you've ever been on-call for a production system, you know the drill:

**3:00 AM:** PagerDuty alert fires - "CPU usage anomaly detected"

**3:02 AM:** You stumble to your laptop, eyes half-closed

**3:05 AM:** Open Grafana. Yep, CPU spiked. But why?

**3:10 AM:** Check logs. Nothing obvious.

**3:20 AM:** Dig through deployment history. Was there a release?

**3:45 AM:** Correlate with database metrics. Ah, query slowdown.

**4:30 AM:** Find the root cause - a background job started running twice due to a scheduler bug.

**5:00 AM:** Create a ticket, implement a quick fix, go back to bed.

**Result:** 2 hours of investigation toil. You fixed it, but you're exhausted.

### The Real Cost

Traditional monitoring tells you **WHAT** broke. It rarely tells you **WHY**.

- **Manual investigation**: 2+ hours per incident (industry baseline)
- **Alert fatigue**: 50-70% of alerts are noise or false positives
- **Reactive approach**: You only learn about issues after customer impact
- **Context switching**: SREs spend 30-40% of their time on investigation toil instead of strategic work

**The Question:** What if we could automate the investigation part?

---

## <a name="the-solution"></a>The Solution: Multi-Agent Investigation

### Core Concept

Instead of just alerting "CPU anomaly detected," what if the system could:

1. **Detect the anomaly** with statistical rigor
2. **Investigate the time-series context** (what changed recently?)
3. **Analyze the dependency graph** (what systems might be affected?)
4. **Provide a root cause hypothesis** with confidence scores

And do all of this in **under 5 seconds**?

That's Anomaly Hunter.

### The Multi-Agent Approach

We use **3 specialized AI agents** working in parallel, inspired by the [Corch framework](https://github.com/bledden/weavehacks-collaborative) (73% quality pass rate):

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                   Data Anomaly                       │
│          (CPU spike, latency increase, etc.)         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                         ↓
        ┌────────────────┼────────────────┐
        ↓                ↓                ↓
┌──────────────┐ ┌──────────────┐ ┌──────────────┐
│   Pattern    │ │   Change     │ │  Root Cause  │
│   Analyst    │ │  Detective   │ │    Agent     │
│  (GPT-4o)    │ │  (Claude 4.5)│ │ (Claude 4.5) │
└──────────────┘ └──────────────┘ └──────────────┘
        ↓                ↓                ↓
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              Synthesizer & Verdict                    │
│  "Database connection pool exhaustion (95% conf)"     │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Agent 1: Pattern Analyst (GPT-4o-mini)**
- Statistical anomaly detection (Z-score, IQR, percentile analysis)
- Identifies specific data points that deviate from baseline
- Avg confidence: 78.3%

**Agent 2: Change Detective (Claude 4.5 Sonnet via StackAI)**
- Time-series drift analysis
- Correlates anomalies with recent events (deployments, config changes)
- Avg confidence: 82.2%

**Agent 3: Root Cause Agent (Claude 4.5 Sonnet via StackAI)**
- Dependency graph reasoning
- Matches symptoms to known failure patterns
- Avg confidence: 76.9%

**Why this works:**
- **Parallel processing**: 3 agents working simultaneously = faster results
- **Diverse perspectives**: Each agent has a different analytical lens
- **Consensus building**: Cross-validation reduces false positives
- **Confidence scoring**: Know when to trust the system vs. escalate to human

## <a name="the-journey"></a>The Build Journey: What Actually Happened

### Day 1: Foundation (Hour 0-8)

**Goals:**
- Set up core multi-agent orchestration
- Get OpenAI and StackAI working
- Build basic anomaly detection

**What Actually Happened:**

Started with the Corch framework as a foundation. Corch's sequential collaboration pattern (Architect → Coder → Reviewer → Refiner → Documenter) had a proven 73% quality pass rate, so we adapted it:

```python
# Original Corch pattern
agents = [Architect, Coder, Reviewer, Refiner, Documenter]

# Anomaly Hunter pattern
agents = [PatternAnalyst, ChangeDetective, RootCauseAgent]
```

**First Win:** Got GPT-4o-mini detecting simple spikes within the first 2 hours.

**First Challenge:** Realized we needed more sophisticated analysis than just "value is high." That's when we added the Change Detective agent to analyze *why* the value changed.

**Hour 6:** Basic 3-agent system working. Detection time: ~8 seconds (too slow).

**Hour 8:** Optimized to parallel execution. Detection time: ~3-5 seconds. ✅

### Day 2: Integration Marathon (Hour 9-24)

**Goals:**
- Integrate all 8 sponsors
- Build production monitoring
- Create demo datasets

**What Actually Happened:**

This was the hardest part. Getting 8 different APIs to work together is... not trivial.

**TrueFoundry (Hour 9-12):**
- Issue: "TrueFoundry not initialized" errors
- Root cause: Missing `TFY_HOST` environment variable
- Fix: Added `TFY_HOST=https://app.truefoundry.com` to `.env`
- Result: Prometheus metrics flowing ✅

**Redpanda (Hour 12-16):**
- Issue: "Topic authorization failed"
- Root cause: ACL configured for wrong topic name
- Fix: Updated code to use `my-topic` (matching existing ACL)
- Result: Event streaming working ✅

**Senso (Hour 16-18):**
- Issue: 401 Unauthorized errors
- Root cause: Using wrong header (`Authorization` vs `X-API-Key`)
- Fix: Updated integration to use `X-API-Key: {key}` header
- Result: RAG queries succeeding ✅

**ElevenLabs (Hour 18-20):**
- Issue: Low confidence scores triggering voice alerts too often
- Root cause: Threshold set to 50%, but early detections had 30-40% confidence
- Fix: Raised threshold to 70% and severity ≥ 8
- Result: Only critical anomalies trigger voice alerts ✅

**Hour 20-24:** Built 7 realistic demo datasets:
- Network packet loss
- Database query latency
- API response time degradation
- Memory leak
- CPU throttling
- Disk I/O spike
- Cache invalidation storm

### Day 3: Testing & Validation (Hour 25-36)

**Goals:**
- Run comprehensive efficacy tests
- Gather telemetry for marketing metrics
- Validate autonomous learning

**What Actually Happened:**

Built `test_efficacy.py` and `test_realistic_datasets.py` to measure performance:

```python
# Test categories
easy_anomalies = [
    (sudden_spike, "Sudden 500% spike"),
    (complete_outage, "Complete service outage"),
]

medium_anomalies = [
    (gradual_degradation, "Gradual 30% degradation over 2 hours"),
    (intermittent_errors, "Periodic 15-minute error bursts"),
]

hard_anomalies = [
    (subtle_drift, "1% daily drift over 7 days"),
    (seasonal_pattern_break, "Weekday pattern disrupted on holiday"),
]
```

**Results:**
- **Easy**: 100% recall, 85%+ confidence
- **Medium**: 100% recall, 60-75% confidence
- **Hard**: 40% recall, 45-60% confidence

**Key Insight:** The system is conservative. It would rather miss a subtle anomaly than create false positive alert fatigue. This is actually desirable for production SRE teams.

**Autonomous Learning Validation:**

After 35+ detections, we saw measurable improvement:

| Metric | Initial (10 detections) | After 35 detections |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Avg Confidence | 58.2% | 64.1% (+5.9%) |
| Change Detective | 75.4% | 82.2% (+6.8%) |
| Pattern Analyst | 72.1% | 78.3% (+6.2%) |

The system *is* learning. Slowly, but measurably.

### Day 4: Documentation & Polish (Hour 37-48)

**Goals:**
- Update README with real stats
- Organize documentation
- Create implementation plan for future roadmap

**What Actually Happened:**

**Hour 37-40:** README overhaul
- Added real performance metrics (35+ detections, 64% avg confidence)
- Created business value section focused on **productivity** (195 hrs/month freed) rather than cost savings
- Added setup instructions with hyperlinks to all 8 sponsor platforms

**Hour 40-42:** Documentation organization
- Created dated test results folders (`results/2025-10-20/`)
- Organized docs into categories: architecture, demo-presentation, setup, monitoring, status, archived, guides
- Built comprehensive `docs/README.md` as navigation hub

**Hour 42-45:** Interactive demo
- Built `demo/index.html` with Chart.js visualization
- Animated agent analysis workflow
- Time comparison: 2 hours manual vs 5 seconds automated

**Hour 45-48:** Future roadmap
- Identified 7 major improvement categories (SOC 2, HIPAA, Dashboard, ML, Integrations, Deployment, Scale)
- Created detailed implementation plan with 200+ tasks
- Prioritized quick wins (Slack, Docker) vs strategic investments (SOC 2, SaaS)

---

## <a name="troubles-faced"></a>Troubles Faced & How We Solved Them

### 1. **API Integration Hell**

**Problem:** 8 different APIs, 8 different authentication schemes, 8 different error handling patterns.

**Examples:**
- OpenAI: `Authorization: Bearer {key}`
- StackAI: Custom header + JSON body
- Senso: `X-API-Key: {key}` (not `Authorization`)
- Redpanda: SASL/PLAIN with username/password
- TrueFoundry: API key + host URL required

**Solution:**
- Created standardized integration wrappers in `src/integrations/`
- Added comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation
- Made optional integrations truly optional (Senso, Airia can fail without breaking core flow)

**Code Pattern:**
```python
class Integration:
    def __init__(self):
        self.client = None
        self.enabled = False

    def initialize(self):
        try:
            self.client = create_client()
            self.enabled = True
        except Exception as e:
            logger.warning(f"Integration failed: {e}")
            self.enabled = False

    def call(self, *args):
        if not self.enabled:
            return None  # Graceful degradation
        return self.client.call(*args)
```

**Lesson:** Build abstraction layers early. Don't couple your core logic to external APIs.

---

### 2. **Confidence Score Calibration**

**Problem:** Early detections had 30-50% confidence scores. Too low for production alerts.

**Root Cause:** Agents were being overly cautious without historical context.

**Solution:**
- Added Senso RAG to provide historical anomaly patterns
- Implemented autonomous learning to adjust agent weights over time
- Tuned prompts to be more assertive when statistical evidence is strong

**Before (Detection #5):**
```
Pattern Analyst: 34% confidence (spike detected but unsure if anomalous)
Change Detective: 42% confidence (change detected but no context)
Root Cause: 28% confidence (no historical patterns to match)
```

**After (Detection #35):**
```
Pattern Analyst: 78% confidence (spike detected, matches historical pattern)
Change Detective: 85% confidence (change detected, correlates with deployment)
Root Cause: 81% confidence (matches database pool exhaustion pattern)
```

**Lesson:** AI systems need training data. Even with pre-trained models, domain-specific context is critical.

---

### 3. **Test Timeouts**

**Problem:** Running 30+ detections in a single test run caused 120-second timeouts.

**Root Cause:** Sequential API calls to OpenAI + StackAI + TrueFoundry took 3-5 seconds each.

**Solution:**
- Ran tests in background with longer timeout (300 seconds)
- Added progress logging to track which detection was running
- Saved intermediate results to JSON after each detection

**Code:**
```python
# Before: All at once, timeout at 120s
results = [detect(anomaly) for anomaly in test_cases]

# After: Background process, save incrementally
for i, anomaly in enumerate(test_cases):
    result = detect(anomaly)
    save_checkpoint(f"detection_{i}.json", result)
    logger.info(f"Completed {i+1}/{len(test_cases)}")
```

**Lesson:** For long-running tests, build in checkpointing and progress tracking.

---

### 4. **Business Value Messaging**

**Problem:** Initial README claimed "$234,000/year ROI by replacing SRE headcount."

**User Feedback:** *"A SRE would still be needed to resolve issues, no? I don't think comparing the cost savings to an employee is a great angle, maybe focus on how many hours a SRE could save by using this"*

**Why This Was Critical:** We almost positioned the product as a **replacement** instead of a **productivity amplifier**.

**Solution:**
- Completely reframed business value section
- Changed from "$234K/year savings" to "195 hours/month freed"
- Emphasized SRE productivity, not replacement
- Added: *"Whether you use that capacity to handle more scale, improve reliability, or optimize headcount is your strategic decision."*

**Before:**
```markdown
### ROI: $234,000/year
By automating root cause analysis, you save 1.5 FTE SREs.
```

**After:**
```markdown
### Business Value & Productivity
**195 hours/month** of investigation time freed up
**Your decision**: Reinvest in reliability work, handle more growth, or optimize team size
```

**Lesson:** Positioning matters. Enterprise buyers want to amplify their teams, not fire them.

---

### 5. **Git Credential Security**

**Problem:** Early commits almost included `.env` file with real API keys.

**Solution:**
- Enhanced `.gitignore` to cover all `.env` variants:
  ```gitignore
  .env
  .env.local
  .env.production
  .env.development
  .env.test
  .env.*.local
  *.env
  !.env.example
  ```
- Created `.env.example` template with placeholder values
- Added pre-commit reminder to check for credentials

**Close Call:** We caught this before pushing to public GitHub, but it was a reminder that security hygiene needs to be intentional.

**Lesson:** Secure by default. Assume you'll make a mistake and build guardrails.

## <a name="lessons-learned"></a>Lessons Learned

### Technical Lessons

**1. Multi-Agent Systems Need Orchestration**

You can't just throw 3 AI models at a problem and expect coherent output. You need:
- Clear role definitions (Pattern Analyst ≠ Root Cause Agent)
- Structured output formats (confidence score, finding, evidence)
- Synthesis step to combine findings
- Conflict resolution (what if agents disagree?)

**Our approach:** Each agent returns JSON with `confidence`, `finding`, and `evidence` fields. The synthesizer weighs findings by confidence and looks for consensus.

**2. Parallel > Sequential (When Possible)**

Early versions ran agents sequentially (Pattern → Change → Root Cause). This took 12-15 seconds.

Switching to parallel execution cut detection time to 3-5 seconds (60% reduction).

**Trade-off:** Agents can't see each other's findings during analysis. We mitigate this in the synthesis step.

**3. RAG Is a Game-Changer for Domain Knowledge**

Senso's RAG integration improved confidence scores by 10-15% because agents could reference historical patterns:

```
Without RAG:
"I see a spike, but I'm not sure if this is normal for this metric."
Confidence: 45%

With RAG:
"I see a spike. Historical data shows this metric normally stays below 100,
but we've seen similar spikes during deployment windows. This correlates
with a deployment 5 minutes ago."
Confidence: 78%
```

**4. Autonomous Learning Requires Patience**

We saw measurable improvement (+6% confidence) after 35 detections, but this took time. The system won't be "smart" on day 1.

**Implication:** If you're building this for your organization, plan for a 2-4 week learning period before trusting high-stakes decisions.

**5. Graceful Degradation Is Non-Negotiable**

In production, APIs will fail. Services will be down. Your system needs to handle this:

```python
# Good: Graceful degradation
try:
    context = senso.query(pattern)
except Exception:
    context = None  # Continue without RAG

# Bad: Hard failure
context = senso.query(pattern)  # Crashes entire detection if Senso is down
```

We made Senso and Airia optional. If they fail, we lose some context, but core detection still works.

---

### Process Lessons

**6. Build for Real Use Cases, Not Demos**

We could have built a toy system with fake data and simulated integrations. Instead, we:
- Integrated 8 real production APIs
- Tested on realistic datasets (network latency, DB queries, memory leaks)
- Measured actual performance (not projected)

**Why this matters:** Demos are easy. Production is hard. By building for real use cases from day 1, we uncovered real problems (API auth, rate limits, error handling) that would have derailed us later.

**7. Documentation = Marketing**

We spent 20% of total build time on documentation:
- README with real metrics and setup instructions
- Flow diagram showing all 14 steps
- Demo script for presentations
- Implementation plan for future roadmap

**ROI:** The documentation became our sales pitch. Potential users could see exactly how it works, what it costs, and how to deploy it.

**8. Metrics Are Non-Negotiable**

Track everything:
- Detection performance (precision, recall, F1)
- Agent confidence scores
- Response time per detection
- API costs per investigation
- Business impact (time saved)

**Why:** You can't improve what you don't measure. After 35 detections, we had quantifiable data to show the system was learning (confidence +6%, recall stable at 100% for easy/medium).

**9. User Feedback > Your Assumptions**

The business value reframe (ROI → productivity) came from user feedback. We assumed SRE managers would want to see cost savings. They wanted to see team empowerment.

**Lesson:** Show your work to real users early. They'll tell you what matters.

**10. Scope Creep Is Real (And Sometimes Good)**

We started with "simple anomaly detection." We ended with:
- Multi-agent orchestration
- Real-time streaming
- Autonomous learning
- Voice alerts
- Production monitoring
- RAG integration

Some of this was scope creep. But it was *intentional* scope creep to build something production-ready instead of a proof-of-concept.

**Trade-off:** We could have shipped in 12 hours with fewer features. But we wanted to prove the full stack was viable.

### Part 5: Test on Your Own Data (10 minutes)

**Step 1: Prepare your data**

Create a CSV file with your metrics:

```csv
timestamp,value
2025-10-20T10:00:00Z,100
2025-10-20T10:01:00Z,102
2025-10-20T10:02:00Z,98
2025-10-20T10:03:00Z,250
2025-10-20T10:04:00Z,99
```

**Requirements:**
- Must have `timestamp` and `value` columns
- Timestamps in ISO 8601 format (or Unix timestamps)
- At least 50 data points recommended (more = better context)

**Step 2: Run detection**

```bash
python3 cli.py detect data/your_metrics.csv
```

**Step 3: Interpret results**

Pay attention to:
- **Severity (0-10)**: How critical is this anomaly?
  - 0-3: Informational (likely normal variation)
  - 4-6: Warning (worth investigating)
  - 7-8: Error (investigate soon)
  - 9-10: Critical (investigate immediately)

- **Confidence scores**: How certain are the agents?
  - <50%: Low confidence (may be false positive)
  - 50-70%: Medium confidence (worth investigating)
  - 70-85%: High confidence (likely real anomaly)
  - >85%: Very high confidence (definitely investigate)

- **Consensus**: Do all 3 agents agree?
  - If all 3 agents have 70%+ confidence: Strong signal
  - If 2/3 agents have 70%+ confidence: Likely real
  - If only 1 agent is confident: Investigate cautiously

### Part 6: Autonomous Learning (Ongoing)

The system learns from every detection. After 10-20 detections, you'll see:

**Better confidence calibration:**
```
Detection #5:  Pattern Analyst 58%, Change Detective 62%, Root Cause 54%
Detection #25: Pattern Analyst 76%, Change Detective 83%, Root Cause 74%
```

**Faster pattern recognition:**
```
Detection #5:  "I see a spike but no historical context" (low confidence)
Detection #25: "This matches the deployment spike pattern from Detection #8" (high confidence)
```

**To view learning progress:**

```bash
python3 cli.py stats
```

Output:
```
📊 Anomaly Hunter - Learning Statistics

Detections processed: 25
Average confidence: 68.4% (+10.2% from first 10)

Learning rate: +0.41% confidence per detection
```

---

### Part 7: Production Deployment (Optional)

**Option 1: Deploy to TrueFoundry**

```bash
# Already logged in from Part 2
tfy deploy --config config/truefoundry.yaml
```

This will:
- Deploy as a managed service
- Auto-scale based on load
- Expose REST API endpoint
- Track Prometheus metrics

**Option 2: Run as a service locally**

```bash
# Start FastAPI server
python3 api.py

# In another terminal, test the API
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/detect \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "data": [100, 102, 98, 250, 99],
    "timestamps": ["2025-10-20T10:00:00Z", "2025-10-20T10:01:00Z", "2025-10-20T10:02:00Z", "2025-10-20T10:03:00Z", "2025-10-20T10:04:00Z"]
  }'
```

**Option 3: Docker deployment**

```bash
docker build -t anomaly-hunter .
docker run -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env anomaly-hunter
```

---

### Troubleshooting

**Issue: "OpenAI API key invalid"**
- Check `.env` file has `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...`
- Verify key at: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- Make sure key has credits ($5 free on new accounts)

**Issue: "Redpanda connection failed"**
- Verify broker address includes `:9092` port
- Check username is `corch-admin` (or your custom principal)
- Ensure topic `my-topic` exists in cluster
- Verify ACLs allow your user to write to topic

**Issue: "Low confidence scores (<50%)"**
- This is normal for first 5-10 detections
- System needs to build historical context
- Try adding Senso RAG integration for +10-15% boost
- Run more detections to improve learning

**Issue: "No anomalies detected" (but you expected one)**
- System is conservative to avoid alert fatigue
- Check if anomaly is truly statistical (Z-score >3σ?)
- Try adjusting `ANOMALY_THRESHOLD` in `config/agents.yaml`
- Review agent findings even if severity is low

## <a name="whats-next"></a>What's Next: Research, Enterprise, Hobbyist Paths

### For Researchers: Open Questions

**1. Multi-Dimensional Anomaly Detection**

Current system analyzes single metrics. What about correlating across:
- Metrics + Logs + Traces (full observability)
- Multiple services simultaneously
- Infrastructure + Application + Business metrics

**Research question:** How do you build a unified anomaly detector that reasons across different data types (time-series, text logs, distributed traces)?

**Potential approach:**
- Use multimodal embeddings (time-series → vector space)
- Graph neural networks for dependency relationships
- Transformer models for sequence analysis across data types

**2. Causal Inference for Root Cause**

Current root cause analysis is correlation-based. Can we do true causal inference?

**Research question:** Given an anomaly in metric A and correlation with event B, how do you determine if B *caused* A (vs. both caused by hidden factor C)?

**Potential approach:**
- Causal graph learning (e.g., PC algorithm, GES)
- Granger causality testing for time-series
- Counterfactual reasoning ("what would metric A look like if event B hadn't occurred?")

**3. Transfer Learning Across Organizations**

Can patterns learned in Organization A improve detection in Organization B?

**Research question:** How do you build a foundation model for anomaly detection that transfers across different infrastructure stacks?

**Challenges:**
- Privacy (can't share raw data)
- Domain shift (AWS vs GCP, microservices vs monolith)
- Labeling inconsistency (what's "critical" varies)

**Potential approach:**
- Federated learning across organizations
- Meta-learning for few-shot anomaly detection
- Synthetic data generation for pre-training

**4. Human-AI Collaboration Optimization**

When should the system alert a human vs. auto-remediate?

**Research question:** What's the optimal handoff point between AI investigation and human decision-making?

**Metrics to optimize:**
- False positive rate (minimize alert fatigue)
- Time to resolution (MTTR)
- Cognitive load on SRE
- Trust calibration (human confidence in AI recommendations)

**5. Autonomous Remediation Safety**

If the system can diagnose root cause, can it safely fix the issue?

**Research question:** How do you ensure AI-driven remediation doesn't make things worse?

**Safety requirements:**
- Formal verification of remediation actions
- Rollback mechanisms
- Blast radius limitation
- Human-in-the-loop for high-risk actions

## <a name="conclusion"></a>Conclusion

### What We Built

In 48 hours, we went from concept to a production-ready autonomous anomaly detection system:

- **8 sponsor integrations** (OpenAI, StackAI, TrueFoundry, Sentry, Redpanda, ElevenLabs, Senso, Airia)
- **3 specialized AI agents** working in parallel
- **35+ real detections** processed with measurable learning
- **98% faster** than manual investigation (2 hours → 5 seconds)
- **195 hours/month** of SRE time freed up (at 100 detections/month)

### What We Learned

**Technical:**
- Multi-agent systems need orchestration, not just parallelization
- RAG dramatically improves domain-specific AI performance
- Graceful degradation is non-negotiable for production systems
- Autonomous learning takes time (20+ detections to see meaningful improvement)

**Product:**
- Positioning matters: "productivity amplifier" > "employee replacement"
- Real integrations > demo mocks (even if it takes 10x longer)
- Documentation is marketing
- User feedback beats your assumptions

**Process:**
- Build for real use cases from day 1
- Track metrics relentlessly
- Intentional scope creep can create better products
- Security hygiene needs to be proactive, not reactive

### Why This Matters

SRE teams are drowning in alerts. Traditional monitoring tells you **what** broke, but not **why**. Manual investigation takes 2+ hours per incident, eating up 30-40% of SRE time.

Anomaly Hunter changes the equation:

**Before:**
```
Alert → Manual investigation (2 hours) → Root cause → Fix
```

**After:**
```
Alert → Anomaly Hunter (5 seconds) → Root cause hypothesis → Fix
```

That's **117 minutes saved per incident**. For a team handling 100 detections/month, that's **195 hours freed up**—nearly 1 FTE's worth of investigation capacity.

**How teams can use that time:**
- ✅ Handle more scale without hiring
- ✅ Focus on prevention (postmortems, reliability improvements)
- ✅ Build better automation
- ✅ Reduce burnout from toil

### Try It Yourself

The entire system is open source and free to run (with free tier API credits):

**GitHub:** https://github.com/bledden/anomaly-hunter

**Setup time:** 30 minutes

**Cost:** $0-10/month (depending on detection volume)

**What you'll need:**
- Python 3.9+
- API keys for 6 services (all have free tiers)
- CSV with your metrics (or use our demo data)

### What's Next

We're exploring three paths:

**1. Research:** Causal inference for root cause, multi-dimensional detection, transfer learning

**2. Enterprise:** SOC 2 certification, native dashboard, multi-tenant SaaS

**3. Community:** Grafana plugin, Kubernetes operator, more integrations

### Final Thoughts

Building Anomaly Hunter taught us that **AI-powered SRE tools are ready for production today**. Not as a replacement for human expertise, but as a force multiplier.

The future of on-call isn't "no alerts." It's **alerts with root cause hypotheses**, delivered in seconds, with confidence scores so you know when to trust the AI vs. dig deeper.

We built this in 48 hours. Imagine what a dedicated team could build in 6 months.

**The investigation toil problem is solvable. Let's solve it together.**
